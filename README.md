# Motcha iOS
The iOS app of Motcha.

## Description ##

It may take a long time to find out news from different places. Motcha creates a unique information space and helps you build your own personal newspaper. It is not only a great place to check out the latest breaking local and national/international news, but also allows you to customize and make your personalized view of headline stories. Most importantly, it learns as you use it, and brings you the news that are most interesting to you every day.

It is getting very common for people to read news on smartphones, and there are already many apps for it. However, we still want to make something different. Motcha will bring you the best of your favorite news as you can find on the desktop to your phone, and it will use the machine learning technology and get smarter every day as you use it.
